    <div class="matter" style="font-size: larger;">
        <p>In old times the people of the old world namely Asia, Europe and Africa had no reason to believe that there could be Swans in the entire world that were non-White. But when Australia was discovered at the sighting of one <i>Black</i> Swan the whole notion crashed. It takes only one random occurance of an event which will change the course of time. This shows how fragile knowledge gained from observation or experience is. The book is based on concept of Probability and Uncertainity.</p>
        
        <p>The author suggests that we become robust rather than being fragile and illustrates the idea of Robustness by giving an example that in his parents' collection there was a book called <i>Comedies by Plautus</i> which was over 500 years old but looked like any other book, and there is  <i> Amazon's Kindle </i>in the market which is a great invention but has its own set of problems, what to do if there is no electricity or some other technical problem.</p>

        <p>The author states the difference between the two worlds one seemingly being Unefficient, the book is bulky and so <i>pass√©</i> i.e. it is no longer fashionable & the Technology being <i>hip </i> i.e. very fashionable. Now, the problem with technology is that it Optimises things but causes Fragility, the new technical advancements get outdated every season. </p>

        <p>So anything fragile would eventually break and anything robust would survive. A large organization would be a lot more efficient but also a lot fragile. The author explains that there is a high mortality in the species called Businesses seeing how many organizations survived last hundred years, or even seeing the startup culture where over 90% of ventures fail in the first five years of inception. So to protect oneself as an individual or as an organization one should become more robust.</p>

        <p><i>The only way you can understand the world is if you have something at risk.</i> For instance one can look at the events retrospectively preceding a war and declare that it was obvious that certain events occured in that particular order leading to the war, but it is not so obvious when the events are occuring, because random events pop up all the time.</p>
        
        <p>As Moore's Law suggests that computational power doubles every year, the author observes that "Every ten years collective wisdom degrades by half". After the internet was invented there has been a constant rise in complexity and the planet started getting smaller. As the result of Globalisation there is a rise in clustering, if we see in terms of laguages there are a lot more people today that speak English, and the whole world reads Harry Potter whereas a hundred years ago there was diversity and there were local poets and writers in local languages. </p>

        <p>So, there is rise in complexity which is made worse by Globalisation and Internet, things run smoothly under these conditions except when there is an accident. Also there are extremely large companies the sheer scale of the operation makes them more fragile to ups and downs in the market and they fall.</p>

        <p>Explaining Leverage the author says if he has a $100 capital and has a brilliant idea for a business for instance which will give him a 8% return every year with a high degree of certainity attached to his forecast. So, now there are two options borrowing against 5% thus leveraging himself or if being skeptical he can just sit there and not do anything about it because if he fails then he will fall with a Thud! </p>

        <p>Borrowing maps one-to-one with confience you have about the future, it is lot more optimal to borrow if you are right but if you are wrong it is a lot worse, so people are not going to be encouraged to borrow. This same thing can be translated into the way we operate the inventory and all, If you don't have a glitch everything is right, but if you have a glitch like a shortage you'll be in trouble.</p>

        <p>Physically we take antibiotics thus we make ourselves less robust for the next epidemic thus we make ourselves more fragile. It took 200 years for doctors to stop killing patients by bleeding them out for every ailment which was a standard procedure at that time, and doctors didn't wanted to do anything that other doctors did not do. This is called institutional stickyness.</p>

        <p>In the author's perfect society, people like those will be destroyed naturally, as mother nature acts by destroying and not by teaching or preaching. You cannot forecast what will happen in the future, there is an exponential growth and even a small change in assumption say higher interest rate will change the economic forecast by orders of magnitude. This is illustrated in Butterfly Effect of the Chaos Theory, where even smallest change in initial conditions can have drastic differences in the consequences or the end result.</p>

        <!-- <p>In the author's perfect society there will be robust institutions, there will be no debt. A irresponsible thing to do is to make future generations pay for your mistakes like polluting the planet now and leaving the future generation to deal with it.</p>  -->

        <p>The Ten Principles for a Black-Swan-Robust Society:
            <ol>
                <li>What is fragile should break early, while it's still small.</li>
                <li>No socialization of losses and privitization of gains.</li>
                <li>People who were driving a school bus blindfolded (and crashed it) should never be given a new bus.</li>
                <li>Don't let someone making an "incentive" bonus manage a nuclear plant-or your financial risks.</li>
                <li>Compensate complexity with simplicity.</li>
                <li>Do not give children dynamite sticks, even if they come with a warning label.</li>
                <li>Only Ponzi schemes should depend on confidence. Government should never need to "restore confidence."</li>
                <li>Do not give an addict more drugs if he has withdrawl pains.</li>
                <li>Citizens should not depend on financial assets as a repository of value and should not rely on falliable "expert" advice for their retirement.</li>
                <li>Make an omelet with the broken eggs.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>So, to survive in this unpredictable world you have to build your Character and become Robust and maybe even a little Stoic.</p>
