    <div class="matter" style="font-size: large;">
        <p>When we search on google for a website <b>neog.camp </b>for instance the browser sends requests to the server and documents, style-sheets, javascript files, fonts are downloaded. And for each request there are multiple HTTP Headers which according to the MDN Web Docs <i>let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. </i>Here I will explain different Status Codes that will appear when a request is made to the server.</p>

        <img class="matter-img"  src="neog1.png"/>

        <p>We can see what requests are sent, by checking the <i>Inspect Network Tab </i>which is opened by right-clicking mouse button and seclect "Inspect", and then opening "Network" tab as you can see in the image below. Now when the name of the website is entered and we press the search button, multiple requests are registered and we can see them on the display, along with the name of the request Status Codes can be seen.</p>

        <img class="matter-img" src="neog2.png" />

        <p>The Status-Line part of the HTTP response message is used to inform the clients of their request's result. The standard status codes are divided into five categories and are used to convey the results to the clients' requests.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1xx</strong>: Informational -> Communicates transfer protocol-level information.</li>

                <li><strong>2xx</strong>: Success -> Indicates that the client's request was accepted successfully.</li>
                
                <li><strong>3xx</strong>: Redirection –> Indicates that the client must take additional action to complete their request.</li>

                <li><strong>4xx</strong>: Client Error –> This category of error status codes points the finger at clients.</li>

                <li><strong>5xx</strong>: Server Error –> The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Here is a brief description of some of the Status Codes we encountered:<br><br>
            &emsp;&FilledSmallSquare;<u> 200</u>: It indicates that the REST API successfully carried out whatever action the client requested. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request, for example: <i>GET, HEAD, POST, TRACE.</i><br>
            &emsp;&FilledSmallSquare;<u> 204</u>: It is a response to clients' <i>PUT, POST, DELETE</i> requests and is sent when the REST API declines to send back anu status message.<br>
            &emsp;&FilledSmallSquare;<u> 304</u>: It is used when the resource has not been modified since the last version. Since the client already has a downloaded copy the resource need not be retransmitted.<br>
            &emsp;&FilledSmallSquare;<u> 401</u>: It is sent when the client tried to operate on a resource without proper authorization. The client may have provided the wrong credentials or none at all for the protected resource.<br>
            &emsp;&FilledSmallSquare;<u> 404</u>: It is sent when the REST API is unable to map the client's URL to a resource but may be available in future. If an old resource is permanently unavailable then <i>410(Gone)</i> code should be used.
        </p>
